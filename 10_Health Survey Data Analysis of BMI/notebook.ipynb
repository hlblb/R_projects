Survey of BMI and physical activity\n","<p>We've all taken a survey at some point, but do you ever wonder what happens to your answers? Surveys are given to a carefully selected sample of people with the goal of generalizing the results to a much larger population.</p>\n","<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm\">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)</a> data is a complex survey of tens of thousands of people designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES data includes many measurements related to overall health, physical activity, diet, psychological health, socioeconomic factors and more.</p>\n","<p>Depending on the sampling design, each person has a sampling weight that quantifies how many people in the larger population their data is meant to represent. In this notebook, we'll apply survey methods that use sampling weights to estimate and model relationships between measurements.</p>\n","<p>We are going to focus on a common health indicator, Body Mass Index (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index\">BMI</a> kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and how it is related to physical activity. We'll visualize the data and use survey-weighted regression to test for

Visualize survey weight and strata variables\n","<p>We see from <code>glimpse()</code> that the <code>NHANESraw</code> data has many health measurement variables. It also contains a sampling weight variable <code>WTMEC2YR</code>.</p>\n","<p>Since <code>NHANESraw</code> data spans 4 years (2009&ndash;2012) and the sampling weights are based on 2 years of data, we first need to create a weight variable that scales the sample across the full 4 years. Currently the weights sum to 2 times the US population number, so we need to divide the 2-year weight in half so that in total, the sum of the weights is equal to the US population.</p>\n","<p>The NHANES data has oversampled some geographic regions and specific minority groups. By examining the distribution of sampling weights for each race, we can see that Whites are undersampled and have higher weights while oversampled Black, Mexican, Hispanic people have lower weights since each sampled person in these minority groups represents fewer US people.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"12"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true,"vscode":{"languageId":"r"}},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<table
